About
-----
The Immediate Graphical Widgets library implements the immediate gui concept.
The library provides the following widgets so far:

* cursor
* label
* button
* slider
* progress bar
* checkbox
* editbox (partially implemented)

The purpose of the library is to be cross-API. Currently only glut is supported 
but I plan to implement sdl and ncurses support in the future.

Dependencies
------------
* glut
